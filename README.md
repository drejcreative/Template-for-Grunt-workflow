![Template for Grunt workflow with Git, Sass, Compass and Susy responsivce framework](img.jpg)

This is my template for simple Grunt workflow with Git, Sass, Compass, Susy and Breakpoint. This template give you few thing. First, grunt with compass compile your Sass into css, then automatically minify your javascripts, then give you livereload of your web project in browser.

##Instructions

Make sure you have these installed

1. [Node.js](hwww.nodejs.org).
2. [git](www.git-scm.com).
3. [grunt](www.gruntjs.com). Install grunt.js via the Mac terminal or Gitbash on a PC > `npm install -g grunt-cli`
4. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) Install Sass via the Mac terminal or console on a PC > `gem install sass`

Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (mac) or Gitbash (PC)
`git clone  https://github.com/drejcreative/Template-for-Grunt-workflow.git`

CD to the folder with workflows
Run > `npm install` to install the project dependencies

Run the Grunt command > `grunt`

And thats it. Livereload will automatically open your browser and give you live preview of your work
